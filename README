Hello there! 
so this is my DWM setup and I think its pretty rad ngl I have a install script, but its only for fedora. I will add more distros later but tbh not now because I'm tired. the install script is called fedora-install.sh all you have to do is, chmod +x fedora-install.sh && sudo ./fedora-install.sh

Bye
